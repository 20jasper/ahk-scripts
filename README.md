Some good AutoHotKey scripts that I keep in my startup folder

media keys gives you the ability to go to the previous/next song, raise/lower the volume, and play/pause the volume if your keyboard doesn't have dedicated buttons for it

text replacement lets you type em and en dashes much easier

CapsLockCtrlEscape sets caps lock to escape when pressed alone and ctrl when pressed in combination with another key

Also I just added my .inputrc config, which sets vim instead of emacs in your cli!
